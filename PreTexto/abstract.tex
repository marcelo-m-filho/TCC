The goal of the project is to develop and assemble a device capable of altering and enhancing sound signals from laptops and mobile phones when connected to headphones. Through digital signal processing and quality conversion/amplification, it can reduce bottlenecks in the audio delivery process from its stored digital version to the final analog step. Its main utility is in improving low and mid-end headphones, which, after having its raw data processed by this product, can obtain a better sound experience without the need for expensive equipment. The device should also be self-contained (i.e. without the need for specific drivers or software on the platform to which it is connecting) to allow for greater flexibility in its use.
