The goal of the project is to develop and assemble a device capable of altering and enhancing sound signals from laptops and mobile phones when connected to headphones. Through digital signal processing and quality conversion/amplification, it can reduce bottlenecks in the audio delivery process from its stored digital version to the final analog step. Its main utility is in improving low and mid-end headphones, which, after having its raw data processed by this product, can obtain a better sound experience without the need for expensive equipment. The developed device is also portable and self-contained (i.e. without the need for specific drivers or software on the platform to which it is connecting) to allow for greater flexibility in its use.

For that end, a portable and self-sufficient (i.e. without the need for specific drivers or proprietary software on the platform to which it is connecting) device was developed. The device is able to alter the signal in a linear fashion (such as changing its volume), and also apply more complex effects such as equalization by composing multiple filters.
